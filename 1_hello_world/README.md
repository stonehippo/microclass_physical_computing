# Hello, World

It's a long-standing tradition to begin learning any new programming language with a little program called **Hello, World**. 

In Python, it's simple to implement **Hello, World**:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

Even with this simple program, we can learn a few things about Python. First, it's meant to be easy to read and understand. Things are often named what you might expect.

Second, Python strives to keep it's structure minimal and clean. There's no need for special end of line characters.

Third, **Hello, World** shows us the invocation of a *function*, in this case `print()`. This function takes one or more *arguments* and the prints the to console, or standard output. In this case, we're giving it the argument '"Hello, world!", which is *string* of text. `print()` can handle other types of data, too, but we won't worry about that right now.
